# OK_Cupid_Shiny
Data Visualization project for OK Cupid data set

# Setup steps
1. Add the `3-profiles.csv` file to your project root
2. Install required packages
For `rflow` package installation, devtools is needed:
 ```
 install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("numeract/rflow")
```
3. Run server.R
4. First run will take a while given the fact that the project uses a cacheing mechanism. 
After the firs run Shiny app will run smoothly.
